# Python-Lessons-for-Hamid-and-Joe
Python lessons
Week 1: 
•	Built-in functions and importing modules.
•	Documentation is everything! (and StackOverflow).
•	Command prompt and IDEs.
•	Different types of Pythonic variables/data types, such as, string, integers, floats, complex, bools
•	Different types of Pythonic objects, such as, lists, dictionaries, tuples.
•	Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
Week 2: 
•	Lists: indexing, built-in list functions, iterating.
•	Iterating: for and while loops.
•	Functions: created basic functions. 
Homework: 
1.	YouTube tutorials and documentation on for and while loops.
2.	YouTube tutorials and documentation on Pythonic functions
3.	Documentation for Python data type list
4.	YouTube tutorials on SCOPING. Local and global variables.
Exercises: 
1.	Write a list of 10-12 items, and then write a for loop that iterates through every other element of the list (Hint: Look at slice notation online).
2.	Write a function that takes in 2 arguments of integers and sums up the integers.
3.	Write a function that takes in 3 arguments of integers, and then returns the maximum integer out of the 3.
4.	Write a function that takes in a list and then returns all even numbers from the list.
5.	Write a function where I can input 2 arguments of integers and it sums up every number in between the two intergers. Example, (2,5) = 2+3+4+5. (Hint: use range).
Week 3: 
•	Creating more complex functions. Looking at *args and **kwargs. 
•	Looking at scoping in more detail.
